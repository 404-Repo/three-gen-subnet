    "# 404—GEN | SUBNET 17\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how the 404-GEN subnet works — a decentralized network where miners generate 3D PLY files with Gaussian splats based on either text or image prompts.\n",
    "Miners pull generation tasks directly from validators, create 3D outputs, and submit their results for validation. Validators then provide feedback, apply cooldowns or penalties, and use duel-based comparisons (via LLMs) to update miner ratings.\n",
    "Through this demo, you’ll see how tasks are distributed, validated, and rewarded — illustrating the full miner lifecycle within the subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Miner Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Each miner operates independently, continuously requesting generation tasks from validators, producing PLY outputs, and submitting results for validation. The validator provides feedback that determines when the miner can submit the next task.\n",

    "## Core Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes how the subnet regulates miner behavior and performance through timing, validation, and feedback mechanisms. These parameters determine how efficiently a miner can operate and how rewards are assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cooldown\n",
    "After submitting results, each miner enters a cooldown period defined by `cooldown_until`.\n",
    "During this time, the miner cannot request new tasks from the same validator.\n",
    "Cooldowns help balance the load and give validators the time to complete validation and duels.\n",
    "### Cooldown Penalty\n",
    "If a miner’s result fails validation, an additional penalty is applied to extend the cooldown.\n",
    "Submitting **empty results** avoids this penalty but yields no reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cooldown Violation\n",
    "If a miner ignores the cooldown limit and attempts to pull tasks prematurely, the validator applies `cooldown_violations`.\n",
    "After exceeding a configured threshold (typically 100), the miner’s cooldown is temporarily increased as a deterrent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Throttle Period\n",
    "Each task defines a `throttle_period`, typically 30 seconds, representing the expected completion window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooldown is reduced by the miner’s actual task duration, up to the throttle limit.\n",
    "Finishing too early does not shorten cooldown beyond this limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with 60s base cooldown and 20s throttle:\n",
    "* 5s completion → 55s cooldown\n",
    "* 15s completion → 45s cooldown\n",
    "* 20s or more → 40s cooldown\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Repull\n",
    "Miners may re-pull the same task multiple times.\n",
    "This supports miner restarts, migration between hosts, or recovery from network errors.\n",
    "A miner can safely re-pull a task and resubmit identical results to ensure the submission is accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Duels and Rating\n",
    "Validators periodically compare results from two miners for the same prompt using an LLM.\n",
    "The comparison outcome determines the winner of a **duel**, and both miners’ ratings are updated using the **Glicko2** system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher rating reflects consistent quality relative to peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rewards\n",
    "Each miner’s reward is proportional to both performance and consistency:\n",
    "```\n",
    "miner_reward = duel_rating × accepted_results_in_last_4h\n",
    "```\n",
    "The rating captures quality, while the result count captures throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimal Miner Behavior\n",
    "A high-performing miner should:\n",
    "* Win duels consistently (high fidelity and quality).\n",
    "* Complete each generation within 30s.\n",
    "* Request new task immediately after cooldown expires.\n",
    "* With a 300s cooldown, this allows ~48 tasks in 4 hours;\n",
    "with 120s cooldown, up to 120 tasks in 4 hours..\n"

    "Objects are selected from a curated list of categories (currently 30), derived from industry analysis and marketplace trends.\n",
    "These categories can be expanded or refined to align with evolving 3D generation needs.\n",
    "#### Prompt Generator 1\n",
    "Focuses on generating natural, human-like prompts.\n",
    "It randomly samples initial letters for both object category and object name, prompting the LLM to:\n",
    "1. Select a matching category and object.\n",
    "2. Write a concise, descriptive one-sentence prompt.\n",

    "### Gateway Architecture\n",
    "The gateway system is built on a distributed consensus architecture using Raft (OpenRaft) to achieve coordination across nodes. The transport protocol leverages QUIC for fast, low-latency communication while encrypting all data, and the API layer operates over HTTP/3 for modern web standards compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution employs a fully non-blocking concurrency model with lock-free algorithms throughout, designed to support high throughput capable of handling over 100,000 user requests per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "All nodes in the cluster maintain a synchronized global state through log replication. This state includes each node's domain, IP address, available task count, and timing metadata, enabling intelligent load balancing and routing decisions. When validators request tasks, they receive both the task data and the current cluster state, allowing them to optimize subsequent requests based on factors like geographic proximity, queue depth, and latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validators initially source tasks from the geographically closest gateway node to minimize latency, but implement dynamic load balancing to pull tasks from distant nodes when necessary to maintain overall system performance. Organic traffic maintains priority status and is directed to miners first, preserving the core workflow.\n",
    "\n",
